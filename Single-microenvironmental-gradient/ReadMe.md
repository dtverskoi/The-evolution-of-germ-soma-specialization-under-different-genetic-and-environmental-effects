Main_1gradient.m is a Matlab implementation of the model for the case of a single microenvironmental gradient.
This code automatically simulates the model 20 runs and shows the results on the average equilibrium characteristics of colonies.

Figures_1gradient.m visualizes the results of our numerical simulations for the case of a single microenvironmental gradient using 
datafiles produced by Main_1gradient.m.
