Main_random.m is a Matlab implementation of the model for the case of random microenvironmental effects.
This code automatically simulates the model 20 runs and shows the results on the average equilibrium characteristics of colonies.

Figures_random.m visualizes the results of our numerical simulations for the case of random microenvironmental effects using datafiles
produced by Main_random.m.
